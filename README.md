# linked_list
Learning linked list in ruby  

## To-do  
-Build linked list and node classes  
-Node class should have a value method and a next_node set to nil by default  
-Build an append method  
-Build a prepend method  
-Build a size method that returns the amount of nodes in the list  
-Head returns first node in the list  
-Tail returns the last node in the list  
-Build 'at(index)' method to return node at given index  
-Pop removes the last node in the list  
-Build contains? method that returns true if list contains the given value, otherwise returns false  
-Build find method that returns the index of the node that contains the given value, otherwise returns nil  
-Build a to_string method that represents the linked list as a string in format '( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil'  
-Build insert_at method that inserts a new node with given value and index  
-Build remove_at method that removes node at the given index  

## Finished  
-stylistically decided to have index arguments that are passed values below or beyond the scope of the list to work on the head or tail as opposed to looping like an array
