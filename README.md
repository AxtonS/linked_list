# linked_list
Learning linked list in ruby  

## To-do  
-Build linked list and node classes  
-Node class should have a value method and a next_node set to nil by default  
-Build an append method  
-Build a prepend method  
-Build a size method that returns the amount of nodes in the list  
-Head returns first node in the list  
-Tail returns the last node in the list  
-Build 'at(index)' method to return node at given index  
-Pop removes the last node in the list  
-Build contains? method that returns true if list contains the given value, otherwise returns false  
-Build find method that returns the index of the node that contains the given value, otherwise returns nil  
-Build a to_string method that represents the linked list as a string in format '( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil'  
-Build insert_at method that inserts a new node with given value and index  
-Build remove_at method that removes node at the given index
